Here comes a long quotation:




<blockquote>
This is a long quotation. This is a long quotation. This is a long quotation. This is a long quotation. This is a long quotation.
</blockquote>

Here comes a short quotation:
<q>
This is a short quotation
</q>

<p>
With the block quote element, the browser inserts line breaks and margins, but the q element does not render as anything special.
